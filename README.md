# Temperature-and-Humidity-Data-Logger

Trying to develop a device that allows temperature and humidity data logging.
Resource available will be a laptop that can standby to record data.
Other option will be to upload data to cloud.

Hardware alternatives:
- Microbit
- ESP32


Using Makecode Microbit is found to have a limitation of 20s. Another means to circumvent this is to sleep the microbit in between data recording.
